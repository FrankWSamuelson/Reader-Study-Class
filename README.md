# Welcome to the Reader Study

This is a web application implementation of a reader study course. Reader studies are diagnostic accuracy studies intended to assess the evaluation of device-generated medical images by human readers. These studies provide essential feedback on the clinical performance of different medical devices, allowing scientists and regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of these devices in diagnostic contexts. This reader study uses generated medical images that may or may not contain a **signal**. Signals are meant to represent abnormalities or diseases that may be present in a real medical scan.

Users can take this assessment in one of two ways.

1. As part of a self-guided web-based course
2. As an interactive lecture where an instructor presents material and controls which portions of the quiz/study are available to the audience
